# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mohamed Mahmoud

âš¡ Front-End Engineer passionate about designing and implementing scalable, maintainable, and well-structured web applications.  

ðŸ”¹ I focus on applying software engineering principles and architectural patterns to the front-end â€” ensuring clean codebases, reusable components, and sustainable project growth.  
ðŸ”¹ My work goes beyond UI; I treat the front-end as an engineered system, balancing performance, scalability, and developer experience.
