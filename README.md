<h1 align="center" style="color: #B0BBC0;"> I'm Mohamed Mahmoud</h1>

**Front-End Engineer** — I architect and build scalable, high-performance web experiences grounded in clear engineering principles and robust architecture.

- I design maintainable front-end systems with reusable components, clean code, and modular structure—ensuring long-term productivity and project growth.
- My work emphasizes user experience, performance, and collaboration: I implement lazy loading, code-splitting, and performance optimizations that translate directly into measurable improvements.
- I value engineering beyond visuals: treating the front-end as a system, I prioritize scalability, accessibility, and developer ergonomics.
- Driven by continuous learning, I adopt modern architectures, clean code practices, and efficient workflows to deliver engineered solutions—not just interfaces.
